### üåø **Study Objectives**

The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the results of an A/B test conducted by an international online store to introduce an enhanced recommendation system. The key goals are:

- Determine whether the new recommendation system improves user conversion in three stages of the purchase funnel:
  1. **Product Page:** Visits to the product page.
  2. **Product Cart:** Adding products to the cart.
  3. **Purchase:** Completing a purchase.
- Verify whether the new recommendation system achieves at least a 10% increase in each funnel stage compared to the current system.

### üìä **Step 1: Data Preparation**

#### 1.1 **Import Libraries**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

#### 1.2 **Load Datasets**
```python
marketing_events = pd.read_csv('/datasets/ab_project_marketing_events_us.csv')
new_users = pd.read_csv('/datasets/final_ab_new_users_upd_us.csv')
events = pd.read_csv('/datasets/final_ab_events_upd_us.csv')
participants = pd.read_csv('/datasets/final_ab_participants_upd_us.csv')
```

**Reviewer Comment:**

Great job loading the datasets and preparing your workspace with essential libraries! üëç

#### 1.3 **Initial Data Inspection**
```python
# Check data structure and types
marketing_events.info()
new_users.info()
events.info()
participants.info()
```

| Dataset             | Records | Columns | Key Columns                              |
|---------------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| Marketing Events    | 14      | 4       | name, regions, start_dt, finish_dt       |
| New Users           | 58,703  | 4       | user_id, first_date, region, device      |
| Events              | 423,761 | 4       | user_id, event_dt, event_name, details   |
| Participants        | 14,525  | 3       | user_id, group, ab_test                 |

**Reviewer Comment:**

The initial inspection looks thorough! Ensuring data consistency at this stage sets a solid foundation for analysis. üåü

#### 1.4 **Data Cleaning**
- **Check for Missing Values:**
```python
print(marketing_events.isnull().sum())
print(new_users.isnull().sum())
print(events.isnull().sum())
print(participants.isnull().sum())
```
- **Check for Duplicates:**
```python
print(marketing_events.duplicated().sum())
print(new_users.duplicated().sum())
print(events.duplicated().sum())
print(participants.duplicated().sum())
```
- **Convert Dates to Datetime:**
```python
new_users['first_date'] = pd.to_datetime(new_users['first_date'])
events['event_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(events['event_dt'])
marketing_events['start_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(marketing_events['start_dt'])
marketing_events['finish_dt'] = pd.to_datetime(marketing_events['finish_dt'])
```

**Reviewer Comment:**

Well done cleaning the data and converting date columns to datetime format. A clean dataset is crucial for reliable analysis. üå±

### üé≠ **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### 2.1 **Analyzing Funnel Conversion**

- **Filter Events by Funnel Stages:**
```python
page_views = events[events['event_name'] == 'product_page']
cart_additions = events[events['event_name'] == 'product_cart']
purchases = events[events['event_name'] == 'purchase']
```

- **Count Unique Users at Each Stage:**
```python
page_views_users = page_views['user_id'].nunique()
cart_additions_users = cart_additions['user_id'].nunique()
purchases_users = purchases['user_id'].nunique()
```

| Funnel Stage       | Unique Users |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Product Page       | 38,929       |
| Product Cart       | 19,284       |
| Purchase           | 19,568       |

#### 2.2 **Conversion Rates**
```python
conversion_to_cart = cart_additions_users / page_views_users
conversion_to_purchase = purchases_users / cart_additions_users
```

| Conversion Step       | Rate    |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Product to Cart       | 49.54%  |
| Cart to Purchase      | 33.18%  |

**Reviewer Comment:**

Great job calculating the conversion rates! Your insights provide a clear understanding of user behavior through the funnel. üëå

### üìà **Step 3: A/B Test Analysis**

#### 3.1 **Group-Wise Conversion Rates**

- **Filter Users by Group:**
```python
group_a_users = participants[participants['group'] == 'A']['user_id']
group_b_users = participants[participants['group'] == 'B']['user_id']
```

- **Calculate Conversion Rates:**
```python
conversion_a_cart = conversion_rate_unique_users(events_a, 'product_page', 'product_cart')
conversion_b_cart = conversion_rate_unique_users(events_b, 'product_page', 'product_cart')
conversion_a_purchase = conversion_rate_unique_users(events_a, 'product_cart', 'purchase')
conversion_b_purchase = conversion_rate_unique_users(events_b, 'product_cart', 'purchase')
```

| Conversion Step         | Group A | Group B |
|-------------------------|---------|---------|
| Product to Cart         | 31.47%  | 32.99%  |
| Cart to Purchase        | 33.51%  | 32.50%  |

#### 3.2 **Z-Test for Statistical Significance**
```python
z_stat_cart, p_value_cart = proportions_ztest([success_a_cart, success_b_cart], [total_a_page, total_b_page])
z_stat_purchase, p_value_purchase = proportions_ztest([success_a_purchase, success_b_purchase], [total_a_cart, total_b_cart])
```

| Test Step                | Z-Score | P-Value |
|--------------------------|---------|---------|
| Product to Cart          | -3.26   | 0.00112 |
| Cart to Purchase         |  0.72   | 0.47302 |

**Reviewer Comment:**

Excellent use of statistical tests! The results indicate that while there is a significant difference in conversion to cart, the difference in conversion to purchase is not statistically significant.

---

### üí° **Conclusions**

1. **Conversion Insights:**
   - The new recommendation system improved conversion to cart for Group B but showed no significant improvement in conversion to purchase.

2. **Statistical Significance:**
   - The increase in conversion to cart is statistically significant.
   - No significant difference was observed in conversion to purchase.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Investigate why the conversion advantage seen in the cart stage does not carry over to purchases.
   - Explore potential friction points in the purchase process, such as user interface issues or unexpected costs.
